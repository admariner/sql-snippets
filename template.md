# Snippet title

# Description
This is a few-line description outlining the usefulness and functionality of this snippet.

This is a template for the query:

```sql
select <a_column> from <a_table>
```
where
- `a_column` - a description of a placeholder
- `a_table` - another description of a placeholder

# Example

Here's an actual SQL query with the placeholders filled in
- `a_column` - this has been filled in with `my_column`
- `a_table` - this has been filled in with `my_table`

then the query becomes:

```sql
select my_column from my_table
```

You may also want to include some example query output:

| my_column | maybe_another_column |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| a         | 1                    |
| b         | 2                    |
| ...       | ...                  |
| z         | 26                   |
